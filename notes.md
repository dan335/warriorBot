### attacking guilds

attack together somehow
attack immediately vs at midnight

Each warrior can attack once every 24 hours.  When your warrior attacks they get a random number.  The number is their attack power against the other guild.  Anyone in your guild can also attack in the next 30 minutes and if they get a better number then it is used instead.  Your guild has 30 minutes to get the best number you can.  After 30 minutes the defending guild rolls 3(?) numbers and uses the best one. The defending guild has 10 minutes to use a warrior's roll to get a better defense number.  Whoever has the highest number wins.  If you attack and win you steal some of their gems.  If you attack and lose some gems and your warrior has a chance of dying.

add optional message to attack
